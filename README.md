The HTML file contains a header where the timer for a quiz begins. The questions and buttons are have id's and classes. The scores would've been stored in the footer. 
In the CSS file the buttons are have been styled to change colors revealing correct answers in green and the wrong answers in red. The box that contains the questions 
has a box shadow to add to the looks, when hovering over the buttons, the border darkens. 
In the javascript file the game starts with a start button. After answering the question the next button pops up. Pressing next will reveal the next question.
After answering the last question a restart button is shown. When the restart button is pressed the game is restarted and the questions are randomly shuffled. Initially 
the code was going to include a highscore chart that records the initals of the person taking the quiz and the score would be based on how fast the person gets through 
quiz.
